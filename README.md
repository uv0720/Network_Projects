### 🧩 SOHO Network Implementation
I designed and implemented a **Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network** to simulate a real-world small business environment.

**Key Highlights:**
- Planned and configured routers, switches, and access points for seamless connectivity  
- Implemented IP addressing, subnetting, and VLANs for efficient traffic management  
- Configured basic firewall rules and access controls to improve network security  
- Tested and troubleshooted the network for reliability and performance
